      <h3>The Plan</h3>
        <p>The vison for this trip has changes quite a bit over the last couple of months but we at this point we intend to sail around the Salish sea, spend some time in various islands of the San Juan Islands (U.S), the Gulf Islands (Canada), Vancouver BC and hopefully the Skidies (BC). The route is still very open, act we haven't figured out much of it yet. We are hoping to sleep mostly at anchor, with some exceptions for cold night, storms or too many days of rain in a row (requiring an electric heater to dry offour clothes). As Jon will still be working on his current software project, we will be exploring libraries a lot and hunting for cafes, wifi and power. Equiped with a 5 gallons water tank, no heater and about 33L (8.75 Gallons) of fuel, we are ready for the challenge!  If winds go as planned, we are leaving Sunday April 30th early in the morning and comming back sometime in July. This is going to be by far our longest trip onbord of Strangewaves!. </p>

        <p> <img class="img-circle" src="images/steph.jpg" alt="Steph" title="Picture of Steph"height="200" width="200" position="center" />That's me. I am the captain and blogger and the one mostly keeping this blog up to date. I will try my best to put updates about where we are and what we are up to every week (depeding on internet connection, power and motivation). My experience with sailing is still relativly recent, my very first encounter on a sailboat was on a 10 footer (would be my guess) on High Lake in Manitoba a few years ago, as I was hitchhiking and got a ride from awesome people, fans of sailing (and Star Wars). My next encounter was on our friends Matt & Kristin's 30ft Rawson (Madrone is her name), Matt, Jon and I went for a sail and had an awesome time, although winds were barely noticiable. During the same winter, I got to crew with our friends <a href="https://baggywrinkles.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"> Jack and Carol</a> (on their 40feet Valiant) and we had an absolutely fantastic time and fabulous sailing. Only a few days after that, I had to leave the U.S (almost the the end of my allowed time of stay in the country) and decided to move to Victoria, right across the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and start looking for a sailboat to buy and live on...      </p>

      <h3>JonO</h3>
      <p><img class="img-circle" src="images/jon.jpg" alt="Jon" title="Picture of Jon" height="200" width="200" position="center"/>Jon, as I am sure you already know (not many people will read this blog is my guess) grew up sailing with his dad on the East Coast and had an interest in sailing since a long time. He had the change to crew with a good friend of ours from Port Tonsend to Pettersberg, AK, a couple of years ago (check out his <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/albums/72157644544117620" target="_blank">pictures</a>). Jon, with his great skill at convincing his friends to get boats (so he gets to crew and not maintain the thing) as had done well with me as well on that regard.
        Jon, as I am sure you know is very mechanic oriented, cooks fabulously, is careful most of the time and for many more reasons makes of him a pretty ideal goofball crew. The only downside to crew him him is that the man only come with a crazy amount of computer stuff (crazy amount for almost strage whatsoever), but hey, that's worth it and without all that ridiculous gear, I would proablby not have put this website up either. </p>

      <img class="withborder" src="images/tanzer7.5.gif" alt="Tanzer 7.5 model picture" Title="Tanzer 7.5"  align="right" <!-- Maybe not useful?  padding="5px" -->
      <p>The Boat is a Tanzer 7.5 (stands for 7.5 meters, so just under 25 feet), built in 1978. She is a sloop and was designed by Johann Tanzer. The 7.5 model was designed with two different keel, the fin keel and shoal keel (the one Strangewaves has), with only 2.67ft draft. She is equipped with a 9.9 horse power 2012 Yahama outbord engine, 5 (19L) Gallons water tank (that's right, but we do have extra gallons statched everywhere), about 33L (8.75Gallons) of fuel capacity, and no source of heating at anchor. We are not sissies (we hope)!</p>
        <p>She was purchased by myself in Victoria, BC in March 2015 as I was looking for both a cheap place to live in Victoria and a way to do more sailing.</p>
        <p>She is certainly not big neither than very roomy, but fantastic boat for some good adventure and building up skilld with a boat that is managlabe.</p>
